                <p>Minesweeper is a logic game for single player. Main part of the game is board with defined number of fields
                    that contains hidden "mines". The goal of the game is to uncover all safe (blank) fields on board without
                    detonating any of hidden "mines" in the quickest time possible. Fields contain clues about the number
                    of neighboring mines in each field.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Game starts when player clicks on first field, and that also starts the timer.</li>
                    <li>First field is always "safe" meaning it can't be a mine.</li>
                    <li>Player can flag a potential mine so he can navigate easier.</li>
                    <li>Player loses game if opens field that contains mine.</li>
                    <li>Player wins if opens all of the "safe" fields.</li>
                    <li>Players are ranked based on time spent to finish the game.</li>
